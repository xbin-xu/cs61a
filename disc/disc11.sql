-- Pizza Time
-- The pizzas table contains the names, opening, and closing hours of great
-- pizza places in Berkeley. The meals table contains typical meal times
-- (for college students). A pizza place is open for a meal if the meal time is
-- at or within the open and close times.

CREATE TABLE pizzas AS
  SELECT "Artichoke" AS name, 12 AS open, 15 AS close UNION
  SELECT "La Val's"         , 11        , 22          UNION
  SELECT "Sliver"           , 11        , 20          UNION
  SELECT "Cheeseboard"      , 16        , 23          UNION
  SELECT "Emilia's"         , 13        , 18;

CREATE TABLE meals AS
  SELECT "breakfast" AS meal, 11 AS time UNION
  SELECT "lunch"            , 13         UNION
  SELECT "dinner"           , 19         UNION
  SELECT "snack"            , 22;


-- Q1: Open Early
-- You'd like to have pizza before 13 o'clock (1pm). Create a opening table
-- with the names of all pizza places that open before 13 o'clock,
-- listed in reverse alphabetical order.
-- opening table:
-- +-----------+
-- | name      |
-- +-----------+
-- | Sliver    |
-- | La Val's  |
-- | Artichoke |
-- +-----------+
-- Pizza places that open before 1pm in alphabetical order
CREATE TABLE opening AS
  SELECT name
    FROM pizzas
    WHERE open < 13
    ORDER BY name DESC;


-- Q2: Study Session
-- You're planning to study at a pizza place from the moment it opens until 14
-- o'clock (2pm). Create a table study with two columns, the name of each pizza
-- place and the duration of the study session you would have if you studied
-- there (the difference between when it opens and 14 o'clock).
-- For pizza places that are not open before 2pm, the duration should be zero.
-- Order the rows by decreasing duration.
-- Hint: Use an expression of the form MAX(_, 0) to make sure a result
-- is not below 0.
-- study table:
-- +-------------+----------+
-- | name        | duration |
-- +-------------+----------+
-- | La Val's    | 3        |
-- | Sliver      | 3        |
-- | Artichoke   | 2        |
-- | Emilia's    | 1        |
-- | Cheeseboard | 0        |
-- +-------------+----------+
-- Pizza places and the duration of a study break that ends at 14 o'clock
CREATE TABLE study AS
  SELECT name, MAX(14 - open, 0) AS duration
    FROM pizzas
    ORDER BY duration DESC;

-- Q3: Late Night Snack
-- What's still open for a late night snack? Create a late table with one
-- column named status that has a sentence describing the closing time of each
-- pizza place that closes at or after snack time.
-- Important: Don't use any numbers in your SQL query!
-- Instead, use a join to compare each restaurant's closing time to the time
-- of a snack. The rows may appear in any order.
-- late table:
-- +--------------------------+
-- | status                   |
-- +--------------------------+
-- | Cheeseboard closes at 23 | 
-- | La Val's closes at 22    | 
-- +--------------------------+
-- Pizza places that are open for late-night-snack time and when they close
CREATE TABLE late AS
  SELECT name || " closes at " || close AS status
    FROM pizzas, meals
    WHERE meals="snack" AND close >= time;


-- Q4: Double Pizza
-- If two meals are more than 6 hours apart, then there's nothing wrong with
-- going to the same pizza place for both, right? Create a double table with
-- three columns. The first column is the earlier meal, the second column is
-- the later meal, and the name column is the name of a pizza place.
-- Only include rows that describe two meals that are more than 6 hours apart
-- and a pizza place that is open for both of the meals.
-- The rows may appear in any order.
-- double table:
-- +-----------+--------+----------+
-- | first     | second | name     |
-- +-----------+--------+----------+
-- | breakfast | dinner | La Val's |
-- | breakfast | dinner | Sliver   |
-- | breakfast | snack  | La Val's |
-- | lunch     | snack  | La Val's |
-- +-----------+--------+----------+
-- Two meals at the same place
CREATE TABLE double AS
  SELECT a.meal AS first, b.meal AS second, name
    FROM meals AS a, meals AS b, pizzas
    WHERE b.time - a.time > 6 AND
      open <= a.time AND
      close <= b.time;
